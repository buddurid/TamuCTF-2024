this is a very easy ARM ROP (trust me it's very easy compared to the one in the RITSEC CTF) . Poblems you might face are setup and debugging so this article might help you * [SETUP](https://blackfell.net/technical/labs/Exploiting-ARM-With-ASLR/) . you could also google ARM rop if you wanna learn further about arm (you're a psyochopath if you do ) . 

to make it quick , i did the equivalent of syscall into execve("/bin/sh") in X86/64 . also we dont need to do a something big about "/bin/sh" string as we have stack leak .
